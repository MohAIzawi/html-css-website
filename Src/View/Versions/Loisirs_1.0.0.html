        <h2>Basketball</h2>
        <p>
          In my teens i played basketball on a national level, with my u17 we were vice-champions <br>
          and Swiss western confernce champions in the u20 category 2 years later. I've always <br>
          had a passion for team sports and invested myself in this beautiful sports as a teen <br>
          and later on as a Coach. I'm proud that the players i've coached went 1 step ahead of <br>
          us and achieved the great feat of becoming Swiss champions.

        <h2>Fitness</h2>
        <p>
          When i started studying and later on working in the hospitality industry i <br>
          didn't have time to play organized sports anymore. That's when i started weight <br>
          lifting and adapting a healthy life style including healthy foods. I was a natural  <br>
          bodybuilder through my 20's and pushed myself and my body to the limits and enjoyed <br>
          every minute of it. This sport enabled me to become more disciplined, more thourough, <br>
          detail oriented in my research, discipline & determination and become more self-confident.

        <h2>Running</h2>
        <p>
          It's not an exageration to say that there's no more liberating <br>
          sport than running long distance, i've practiced endless sports through <br>
          my life organized football, basketball, volleyball and represented my school <br>
          in differ​ent categories of athletics but nothing clears the mind like running <br>
          long distance. We suffer through but liberate ourself from wordly matters <br>
          and the endorphine kick at the end is truely amazing.

        <p>
          Building, customizing, adding rgb and led to the work station ads <br>
          colors and fun to pc building. Following the evolution on new hardware<br>
          and upgrading is fun in itself !This is my latest build, a rx 6800 xt coupled <br>
          with a ryzen 5600x  it was really fun building this pc , my first rgb build.
